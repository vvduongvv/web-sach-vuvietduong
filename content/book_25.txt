Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (AIMA) is the most widely used textbook in artificial intelligence education worldwide. Now in its fourth edition (2020), it has been adopted by over 1,500 universities across 135 countries. The book provides a comprehensive, unified treatment of the field, covering everything from classical search algorithms and logical reasoning to modern machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

Russell and Norvig organize the field around the concept of rational agents — systems that perceive their environment and take actions to maximize their expected utility. This unifying framework ties together the diverse subfields of AI into a coherent whole, from problem-solving and knowledge representation to planning, uncertainty, and learning. The fourth edition significantly expands coverage of deep learning, transfer learning, multiagent systems, robotics, natural language processing, and the societal impact of AI.

What distinguishes AIMA from other AI textbooks is its remarkable balance between breadth and depth. Each topic is treated with sufficient mathematical rigor to be useful to graduate students and researchers, while remaining accessible to undergraduates encountering the material for the first time. The writing is clear and engaging, with historical context and real-world applications woven throughout.

KEY THEMES

1. Rational Agents — The central organizing concept of the book. An agent perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it through actuators, with the goal of maximizing a performance measure. This framework unifies diverse AI approaches.

2. Search and Optimization — From uninformed search (BFS, DFS) to informed search (A*), local search, adversarial search, and constraint satisfaction, the book provides a thorough treatment of how agents can find solutions in complex state spaces.

3. Knowledge and Reasoning — Propositional logic, first-order logic, probabilistic reasoning, and Bayesian networks equip agents with the ability to represent knowledge and make inferences under uncertainty.

4. Machine Learning — Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are covered in depth, including neural networks, deep learning architectures, decision trees, ensemble methods, and statistical learning theory.

5. Ethics and Safety — The fourth edition significantly expands discussion of AI's societal impact, including fairness, transparency, privacy, autonomous weapons, and the long-term risks and benefits of increasingly capable AI systems.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"AI is the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions."

"An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators."

"The quest for artificial flight succeeded when engineers and inventors stopped imitating birds and started learning about aerodynamics. Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons."

"We define AI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Part I: Artificial Intelligence — Introduces AI, intelligent agents, and the various environments in which agents operate. Establishes the rational agent framework that structures the entire text.

Part II: Problem-Solving — Covers search strategies (BFS, DFS, iterative deepening, A*), adversarial search (minimax, alpha-beta pruning), constraint satisfaction problems, and search in complex environments.

Part III: Knowledge, Reasoning, and Planning — Presents propositional and first-order logic, knowledge representation, automated planning, and reasoning under uncertainty with Bayesian networks and Markov processes.

Part IV: Uncertain Knowledge and Reasoning — Explores probabilistic models, hidden Markov models, Kalman filters, decision networks, and utility theory for decision-making under uncertainty.

Part V: Machine Learning — Covers supervised learning (linear models, neural networks, deep learning, SVMs, decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction), reinforcement learning, and statistical learning theory.

Part VI: Communicating, Perceiving, and Acting — Addresses natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and the integration of perception with action in real-world environments.

Part VII: Conclusions — Discusses the present and future of AI, philosophical foundations, ethical considerations, and the potential for artificial general intelligence.

WHY READ THIS BOOK?

In an era when AI increasingly shapes every industry, understanding its foundations is essential for technologists, researchers, and informed citizens alike. AIMA provides the most comprehensive and balanced treatment of the field available in a single volume. Whether you are a student beginning your AI journey or a practitioner seeking to deepen your understanding, this book offers the theoretical grounding and practical knowledge needed to work effectively with AI.

The book's rational agent framework provides a way of thinking about AI that transcends any particular technique or trend. As the field continues to evolve rapidly, this conceptual foundation enables readers to evaluate new developments critically and place them in context. The expanded coverage of ethics and safety in the fourth edition also ensures that readers consider not just what AI can do, but what it should do.
