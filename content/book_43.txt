ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" (originally published as "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" in the UK) is the book that launched a global phenomenon. It introduces Harry Potter, an orphaned boy living a miserable life with his cruel aunt, uncle, and cousin — the Dursleys — in the cupboard under the stairs at Number 4 Privet Drive. On his eleventh birthday, Harry receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he discovers the astonishing truth: he is a wizard.

At Hogwarts, Harry makes his first true friends — the loyal Ron Weasley and the brilliant Hermione Granger — and discovers a world of magic, wonder, and danger. He learns about his parents, who were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, and that he himself somehow survived Voldemort's killing curse as a baby, becoming famous in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived."

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect that someone is trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone — a legendary object that grants immortality — they embark on a perilous adventure that tests their courage, intelligence, and friendship. This first installment sets the stage for one of the most beloved and influential series in literary history.
