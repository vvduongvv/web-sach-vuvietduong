OVERVIEW

Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions is a technical interview preparation book written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Originally self-published in 2008, the book is now in its sixth edition, published in 2015 by CareerCup. It has become the definitive guide for software engineering candidates preparing for technical interviews at major technology companies.

The book provides 189 programming questions and detailed solutions, along with strategies for approaching algorithm and system design problems commonly encountered in interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. It covers the full spectrum of the technical interview process, from resume preparation to behavioral questions to complex coding challenges.

CONTENT AND STRUCTURE

--- Interview Process ---

The book begins with an overview of how the technical interview process works at major technology companies. McDowell draws on her experience as both an interviewer and a candidate to explain what interviewers are actually looking for, how candidates are evaluated, and common misconceptions about the hiring process.

--- Data Structures ---

A significant portion of the book is devoted to questions involving fundamental data structures, including arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Each chapter provides a summary of the relevant concepts followed by increasingly challenging practice problems with complete solutions.

--- Algorithms ---

The book covers a wide range of algorithmic topics including sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, bit manipulation, and mathematical reasoning. McDowell explains not just how to solve each problem but how to develop the problem-solving approach that interviewers want to see.

--- System Design and Scalability ---

Later chapters address system design questions, which are particularly important for more senior candidates. These sections cover topics like designing large-scale distributed systems, database design, and understanding trade-offs between different architectural approaches.

--- Behavioral Preparation ---

The book also includes guidance on the behavioral aspects of technical interviews, including how to structure responses to questions about past projects, teamwork, and leadership.

BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT

Gayle Laakmann McDowell originally wrote the book based on her own experiences preparing for and conducting technical interviews. Before writing the book, she worked as a software engineer at Google, Apple, and Microsoft, and was a member of Google's hiring committee.

The first edition was self-published in 2008 through McDowell's company CareerCup, a website she founded to provide interview preparation resources. The book went through multiple revisions, with each edition expanding the number of questions and refining the solutions based on reader feedback and changes in industry practices.

The sixth edition, published in 2015, contains 189 programming questions and solutions, significantly expanded from the original. The book also includes behind-the-scenes information about how large tech companies structure their interview processes.

RECEPTION AND IMPACT

Cracking the Coding Interview has become the most widely used technical interview preparation book in the software industry. It has been featured in publications including The New York Times, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Fast Company.

The book is commonly recommended by university career centers, coding bootcamps, and online programming communities as essential preparation for technical interviews. It has played a significant role in standardizing how candidates prepare for software engineering interviews and has influenced the broader culture of technical hiring.

McDowell's approach of combining practical coding problems with insights into the interview process from both sides of the table has been credited with demystifying the technical interview and making it more accessible to candidates from diverse backgrounds.

RELATED WORKS

McDowell is also the author of Cracking the PM Interview (co-authored with Jackie Bavaro), which provides similar preparation guidance for product management interviews, and Cracking the Tech Career, which covers the broader technology job search process.

In 2025, McDowell published Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview, updating her guidance for the evolving landscape of technical hiring in the era of artificial intelligence and changing industry practices.
