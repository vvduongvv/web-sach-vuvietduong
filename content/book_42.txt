ABOUT THIS BOOK

"The Love Hypothesis" is a charming and smart contemporary romance by Ali Hazelwood that originated as fan fiction and became a bestselling debut novel. Set in the competitive world of academia, the story follows Olive Smith, a third-year PhD candidate in biology at Stanford who is struggling to balance her research, her friendships, and her disastrous love life.

When Olive needs to convince her best friend Anh that she has moved on from a former fling (who Anh now likes), she impulsively kisses the first man she sees — who happens to be Dr. Adam Carlsen, a notoriously cold and intimidating young professor in her department. To Olive's astonishment, Adam agrees to fake-date her. What follows is a delightful and swoon-worthy journey as their pretend relationship gradually becomes all too real.

Beneath the romantic comedy surface, the novel also addresses serious themes: the challenges women face in STEM fields, the power dynamics in academia, and the importance of advocating for yourself in professional and personal relationships. Hazelwood, herself a neuroscientist, brings authenticity to the academic setting, making Olive's world feel vivid and true.
