ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Matilda" is a delightful and empowering children's novel by Roald Dahl about a brilliant, book-loving girl who discovers she has extraordinary telekinetic powers. Matilda Wormwood is a genius — she teaches herself to read at age three, devours classic literature by five, and can perform complex mathematics in her head. Unfortunately, her parents are ignorant, dishonest, and entirely uninterested in their daughter's remarkable abilities.

When Matilda starts school at Crunchem Hall, she finds a kindred spirit in her teacher, the gentle and encouraging Miss Honey. But she also encounters the school's terrifying headmistress, Miss Trunchbull — a former Olympic hammer thrower who despises children and rules the school through intimidation and cruelty. Miss Trunchbull locks children in "The Chokey," a narrow cupboard lined with nails and broken glass, and thinks nothing of throwing students out windows.

As Matilda learns more about Miss Honey's tragic past and Miss Trunchbull's tyranny, she discovers she can move objects with her mind. Using her intelligence and her extraordinary power, Matilda devises a plan to liberate Miss Honey and defeat the monstrous headmistress once and for all.

KEY THEMES

2. Standing Up to Bullies — The novel celebrates courage in the face of tyranny. Matilda refuses to accept the cruelty of Miss Trunchbull and takes action to stop it.

3. Chosen Family — Matilda finds more love and support from Miss Honey than from her own parents, demonstrating that family can be the people who truly see and value you.

4. Justice and Fairness — Dahl's moral universe is clear: cruelty and dishonesty are punished, while kindness and intelligence are rewarded.

5. The Importance of Kindness — Miss Honey's gentle encouragement transforms Matilda's life, showing the profound impact that one caring adult can have on a child.
