ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Beach Read" is a witty, warm, and surprisingly deep contemporary romance by Emily Henry that follows two writers with opposite styles who challenge each other to swap genres for a summer. January Andrews is a romance novelist reeling from the death of her father and the discovery that he led a secret double life. Her world — and her belief in love — has been shattered, leaving her with brutal writer's block.

Augustus "Gus" Everett is a brooding literary fiction writer who lives next door to January's inherited lakeside cottage. He writes dark, serious novels about human suffering and has little patience for the happily-ever-afters that January once championed. When the two recognize each other from college, old tensions and unresolved attraction reignite.

Stuck in creative ruts, they make a bet: January will write a literary fiction novel, and Gus will write a romance. Over the course of the summer, they research each other's genres, leading them on adventures that blur the line between fiction and reality. As they explore dark corners and tender moments alike, they discover that life — like the best stories — contains both tragedy and love.

KEY THEMES

1. Genre and Perception — The novel playfully deconstructs the literary snobbery that dismisses romance as lesser fiction, arguing that stories about love are just as meaningful as stories about suffering.

2. Grief and Disillusionment — Both January and Gus carry deep grief that shapes how they see the world. January must reconcile her romantic worldview with her father's betrayal.

3. Vulnerability and Connection — The bet forces both writers to step outside their comfort zones, mirroring the vulnerability required to fall in love.

4. Truth in Fiction — The novel explores how writing can be a way of processing life's hardest truths, and how the stories we tell reveal who we really are.

5. Second Chances — Both in writing and in love, the book is about the courage to try again after failure and disappointment.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"I think you're the best person I've ever known. And even when I can't see you, I know you're there."

"Maybe love shouldn't be built on a foundation of lies and denial. Maybe it should be built on a foundation of friendship and respect."

"Loving someone isn't about never fighting; it's about fighting for each other."

"The world is definitely going to break your heart, and I honestly don't know if people are more good than bad, but I believe some people try really hard to be good."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Chapters 1-4: January arrives at her late father's lakeside cottage, expecting solitude. Instead, she finds Gus Everett — her college rival — living next door. Old sparks and old irritations resurface immediately.

Chapters 5-9: Both writers are struggling with deadlines and creative blocks. They strike the bet to swap genres. January begins researching dark subject matter for her literary novel, while Gus awkwardly explores the conventions of romance.

Chapters 10-15: Their research becomes increasingly personal. Gus takes January to interview subjects for her book, including a visit to a struggling community and a local cult. January introduces Gus to the art of building emotional connection on the page. Their professional collaboration deepens into personal intimacy.

Chapters 27-Epilogue: Both writers finish their novels, having been transformed by the summer. January rediscovers her faith in love — not the naive, uncomplicated version, but a richer, more honest kind that acknowledges pain alongside joy.
