ABOUT THIS BOOK

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson is a gripping mystery thriller and the first installment of the Millennium trilogy. Originally published in Swedish as Män som hatar kvinnor (Men Who Hate Women), the novel became an international sensation, selling over 80 million copies worldwide. It combines a locked-room mystery with a sweeping investigation into corruption, violence against women, and the dark secrets hidden beneath the surface of a wealthy Swedish family.

The novel follows two protagonists: Mikael Blomkvist, a recently disgraced investigative journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled young hacker with a photographic memory and a dragon tattoo on her shoulder. Blomkvist is hired by the aging patriarch of the powerful Vanger family to investigate the disappearance of his great-niece Harriet, who vanished from the family's island estate in 1966 without a trace.

As Blomkvist and Salander join forces, they uncover a web of serial murder, sexual abuse, and corporate corruption that stretches back decades. The novel is a relentless page-turner that combines meticulous detective work with unflinching social commentary about violence against women in Swedish society. It is a book that grabs readers from the first page and does not let go.

KEY THEMES

1. Violence Against Women — The original Swedish title translates to "Men Who Hate Women," and this theme is central to the novel. Larsson confronts the reality of sexual violence, domestic abuse, and the systems that enable and conceal it.

2. Justice and the Failure of Institutions — Both Blomkvist and Salander are driven by a desire for justice. The novel explores how legal systems, corporations, and families can fail victims and protect abusers.

3. The Power of Investigation — Investigative journalism and digital research are portrayed as powerful tools for uncovering truth. Blomkvist and Salander represent different but complementary approaches to investigation.

4. Class and Privilege — The Vanger family represents the intersection of wealth, power, and moral corruption. Their fortune was built on questionable dealings, and their secrets are protected by privilege and influence.

5. Identity and Isolation — Lisbeth Salander is one of the most memorable characters in modern fiction. Her brilliance, her antisocial tendencies, her traumatic past, and her fierce independence make her both sympathetic and enigmatic.
