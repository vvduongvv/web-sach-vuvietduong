ABOUT THIS BOOK

The Great Gatsby is widely regarded as one of the greatest American novels ever written. Set in the summer of 1922 on Long Island, New York, it is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young bond salesman from Minnesota who rents a small house next to the lavish mansion of the mysterious Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is famous for his extravagant weekend parties, where hundreds of guests arrive to drink, dance, and revel — yet few know anything about their enigmatic host.

As Nick is drawn into the glittering world of the ultra-wealthy, he discovers that Gatsby's entire fortune and lifestyle have been constructed for a single purpose: to win back the love of Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin and a woman Gatsby fell in love with five years earlier. Daisy is now married to Tom Buchanan, a brutish, old-money aristocrat whose wealth and social position make him untouchable. The tension between Gatsby's romantic idealism and the corrupt reality of the world he inhabits builds toward a devastating conclusion.

Fitzgerald's prose is luminous and precise, capturing both the intoxicating allure and the moral emptiness of the Jazz Age. The Great Gatsby is a meditation on ambition, illusion, and the impossibility of recapturing the past — themes that have made it timeless and universally relevant across nearly a century.

KEY THEMES

1. The American Dream — Gatsby's rise from poverty to wealth embodies the promise of the American Dream, but his story ultimately reveals its hollowness. Wealth does not bring happiness, acceptance, or love.

2. Illusion vs. Reality — Gatsby has constructed an elaborate illusion — of himself, of his past, of his future — that cannot withstand the weight of reality. The novel explores the danger of living in a fantasy.

3. Class and Social Mobility — Despite his wealth, Gatsby can never fully enter the world of old money. The divide between East Egg and West Egg symbolizes the rigid class structures that persist beneath America's democratic ideals.

4. Love and Obsession — Gatsby's love for Daisy has calcified into obsession. He does not love Daisy as she is but rather the idea of Daisy — the green light at the end of her dock, always just out of reach.

5. Moral Decay — Behind the glamour of the Jazz Age lies moral corruption. Tom and Daisy are careless people who smash things up and retreat into their money, leaving others to clean up the mess.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."

"I hope she'll be a fool — that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."

"He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life."

"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us."

"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Chapter 1 — Nick Carraway introduces himself and settles on Long Island. He visits his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan in East Egg. He catches his first glimpse of Gatsby, standing alone on his lawn, reaching toward a distant green light across the water.

Chapter 2 — Tom takes Nick to the Valley of Ashes, where they meet Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson, wife of a garage owner. Above the valley, the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg stare from an old billboard. An ugly, drunken party follows in a Manhattan apartment.

Chapter 3 — Nick attends one of Gatsby's legendary parties. The mansion overflows with music, champagne, and strangers. Nick finally meets Gatsby himself — charming, mysterious, and strangely solitary amid the crowd.

Chapter 4 — Gatsby takes Nick to lunch in New York and reveals fragments of his past. Jordan Baker tells Nick that Gatsby wants him to arrange a reunion between Gatsby and Daisy.

Chapter 5 — The reunion takes place at Nick's cottage. Gatsby is trembling and awkward. He and Daisy reconnect, and for a brief, luminous moment, it seems as though the past can be recovered.

Chapter 6 — Nick reveals Gatsby's true origins: he was born James Gatz, a poor farm boy from North Dakota. Tom attends one of Gatsby's parties, and cracks begin to appear in Gatsby's dream.

Chapter 7 — The climax. On a sweltering afternoon, the confrontation between Gatsby and Tom erupts. Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, strikes and kills Myrtle Wilson. Gatsby takes the blame.

Chapter 8-9 — George Wilson, mad with grief, tracks down the owner of the car. He finds Gatsby floating in his pool and shoots him, then kills himself. At Gatsby's funeral, almost no one comes. Nick reflects on the emptiness of the world Gatsby longed to join.

WHY READ THIS BOOK?

The Great Gatsby endures because it captures something essential about human desire — the yearning for something just beyond our grasp, and the devastating consequences of refusing to let go. In fewer than 50,000 words, Fitzgerald created a novel of remarkable density and beauty, every sentence shimmering with meaning.

It is required reading in classrooms worldwide, but it deserves to be read beyond obligation. The Great Gatsby speaks to anyone who has ever chased a dream, loved someone beyond reason, or looked back at the past with longing. It is a cautionary tale and a love story, a social critique and a prose poem — and nearly a century after its publication, it has lost none of its power.
