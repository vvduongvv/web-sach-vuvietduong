SUMMARY

People We Meet on Vacation is told in a nonlinear narrative, interspersing its protagonist's present vacation with flashbacks from past trips. It follows Poppy Wright and Alex Nilsen, two best friends who are opposites in every way. She is an outgoing, wanderlust-filled wild child, while he is mild-mannered and introverted. Every summer they come together for a week long vacation, until a trip to Dubrovnik causes them to stop speaking for two years.

Although Poppy is living her dream of being a travel writer for R+R, a popular magazine, she realizes she was last truly happy when traveling with Alex. She rekindles their friendship to invite him on vacation, and she agrees to go with him to Palm Springs for his younger brother David's wedding.

Throughout the trip, Poppy recounts their friendship. They are both from the small town of Linfield in Ohio, and first met at the University of Chicago. Poppy was bullied in school and enjoyed writing about traveling as an escape. She and Alex began traveling together on a tight budget, and she kept her attraction to him in check.

Eventually, Alex moved back to Linfield to teach, and Poppy dropped out of college, moved to New York City, and began working for R+R. Their trips became more polished and less spontaneous as a result, and were also complicated by romance: Alex with his on-off girlfriend Sarah, and Poppy with various boyfriends.

In the present day, Alex and Poppy are aghast to arrive at a rented apartment with only one bed and a broken air conditioner. Poppy tries to take them to various tourist destinations around the city, but the heat makes both of them miserable. During a sudden rainstorm, they sleep together and admit their mutual feelings. They happily attend the wedding together. At the airport, Poppy admits that she saw this trip as an escape from her life, and Alex takes offense.

Poppy recalls that in Croatia, she and Alex had drunkenly kissed, but both had construed it as a rejection. Back in New York City, she begins therapy and realizes she tends to run from her problems, and her job is unfulfilling because she is no longer truly connecting with people on her trips. She flies back to Linfield, intending to reconcile with Alex. He admits that he is afraid that they are too different and is scared of losing her like he lost his mother. Alex and Poppy finally become a couple, splitting their time between New York and Linfield.

In a starred review, Kirkus describes the novel as a "warm and winning When Harry Met Sally… update that hits all the perfect notes." Library Journal explains in its starred review that Henry’s book is a story that will appeal to those who "are drawn to stories with emotion, poetic language, and a strong sense of place" and compares it to Kate Clayborn’s Love Lettering. Alicia Rancilio of the Associated Press praises Henry’s writing, even highlighting that she is "especially skilled at is writing dialogue." From The Washington Post, Angela Hurt applauds Henry, saying she "masterfully depicts early-30s uncertainty and angst, adding an interesting personal-growth dimension to the story." Hurt, however, also claims that it still fails to live up to Henry’s previous novel stating, "People lacks the pizazz — the special spark — that helped Beach Read shine." Publishers Weekly concurred, saying that "Henry’s latest rom-com lacks the spark of 2020’s Beach Read, but still offers plenty of lighthearted summertime fun."
