ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry" is Neil deGrasse Tyson's concise and accessible guide to the universe's most profound mysteries. Written for busy people who want to understand the cosmos but don't have time for a textbook, the book distills the essential ideas of astrophysics into short, digestible chapters that can be read during a commute or a lunch break.

Tyson covers an astonishing breadth of material in just over 200 pages: the Big Bang, dark matter, dark energy, the nature of light, the cosmic microwave background, the periodic table's astrophysical origins, and the search for life beyond Earth. Each topic is presented with Tyson's signature blend of scientific rigor and playful humor.

Despite its brevity, the book packs a powerful punch. Tyson's goal is not just to inform but to inspire — to help readers develop a cosmic perspective that can transform how they see the world and their place in it. The final chapter, "Reflections on the Cosmic Perspective," is a moving meditation on what astrophysics reveals about our shared humanity.
