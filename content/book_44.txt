ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Charlotte's Web" is one of the most cherished children's novels ever written. E.B. White's tender story of friendship between Wilbur, a young pig, and Charlotte, a wise and talented spider, has delighted generations of readers with its warmth, humor, and gentle wisdom. When Wilbur learns that he is destined for the smokehouse, Charlotte devises an ingenious plan to save his life — she weaves words into her web praising Wilbur as "Some Pig," "Terrific," and "Radiant," creating a miracle that captivates the entire community.

Set on the Zuckerman farm in rural Maine, the novel opens with young Fern Arable saving the runt piglet Wilbur from being killed by her father. Fern raises Wilbur with love before he is sent to her uncle's barn, where he meets Charlotte A. Cavatica, a large gray spider who becomes his dearest friend and protector. Through Charlotte's creativity and selflessness, Wilbur is saved — but Charlotte's own life follows the natural cycle of her kind.

The novel deals with profound themes — the meaning of friendship, the cycle of life and death, and the power of words — all presented with a simplicity and beauty that speaks equally to children and adults. It is a book about the extraordinary things we do for those we love.
