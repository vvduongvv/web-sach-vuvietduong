PLOT SUMMARY

In the fictional English town of Stokebridge, Louisa "Lou" Clark is hired as a caretaker for Will Traynor, a once successful banker and active sportsman now tetraplegic after being hit by a motorcycle. Will's mother hopes Lou will lift Will's depressed and cynical spirits. Will is initially cold towards Lou. Will's ex-girlfriend Alicia visits and reveals that she is going to marry Will's former best friend Rupert. Lou perseveres with Will, and, as the two grow close, she learns he is cultured and worldly, in contrast to her simple life spent with her parents and her boyfriend Patrick.

Overhearing an argument between Will's parents, Lou learns that, in six months' time, he will travel to Dignitas in Switzerland for assisted suicide. Lou takes it upon herself to change his mind by organizing trips and adventures to show him that life is still worth living. Patrick's jealousy grows until he and Lou split up.

Will asks Lou to accompany him to Alicia's wedding. They start to fall in love. During a luxurious trip to Mauritius, Will tells Lou he still intends to die, saying he wants her to live a full life instead of "half a life" with him. Heartbroken, Lou quits as Will's caregiver and refuses contact with him.

Lou's father convinces her to visit Will, but she finds he has already left for Switzerland. She follows him there to be with him in his final moments. A few weeks after Will's death, sitting at his favourite café in Paris, Lou reads a letter he left for her. In it, he says he has left her enough money to follow her dreams and encourages her to live abundantly.

COSTUME

Jill Taylor, the costume designer, thought Lou would have more of a 'quirky' wardrobe based on the book "she has these ‘leprechaun’ shoes, so we had to find some quirky shoes. By accident, we were in a shop and found these amazing shoes by Irregular Choice, and I just thought, ‘Oh, my God, that's Lou!’ They suddenly became the basis of her wardrobe of shoes.” Will's clothing was more based on his pre-accident life and he generally wore luxurious suits.

--- Critical response ---

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 54% based on reviews from 180 critics, and an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Me Before You benefits from Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's alluring chemistry, although it isn't enough to compensate for its clumsy treatment of a sensitive subject." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.

Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave it a grade of B+ and wrote: "It may not quite rise to the level of a classic three-hankie tearjerker, but it's proof that sometimes one or two hankies is more than enough to get the job done."

--- Controversy and protests ---

The film sparked criticism from many in the disability rights movement, who perceive an underlying message that people with disabilities are a burden on their families and caregivers, and claim the film promotes the view that people are better off dead than disabled. On 25 May 2016, anti-euthanasia campaigners targeted the London premiere at the Curzon Mayfair Cinema as the film has faced criticism over its depiction of disability and its assisted-dying plotline. They view the film as advocacy of suicide so that their loved ones can "live boldly". Others found the film exploitative of the disability community by stirring the emotions of viewers without actually aiding disabled people by accurate representation or employment in acting roles, while pointing out the casting of non-disabled actors as disabled characters. The #MeBeforeEuthanasia backlash was led by celebrities with disabilities including Liz Carr, Penny Pepper, Mik Scarlet and Cherylee Houston in the United Kingdom, and Dominick Evans and Emily Ladau in the United States, as well as activists from Not Dead Yet in both countries. Protests in the United States occurred in cities including Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Hartford, Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. There were also protests in Australia.

In response to the backlash, author Jojo Moyes said the story was inspired by her own family where relatives required 24-hour care, as well as a real-life news story about a quadriplegic man who convinced his parents to take him to a centre for assisted suicide. About Traynor's decision, she said: "The fact is, in the film as in the book, nobody else agrees with what he decides to do. This is not by any means sending out a message. It's just about one character – it's nothing more than that."
