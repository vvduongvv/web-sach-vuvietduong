OVERVIEW

Wonder is a contemporary children's novel written by R.J. Palacio, published on February 14, 2012, by Alfred A. Knopf. The book centers on August "Auggie" Pullman, a ten-year-old boy with Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition that has caused significant facial differences, as he enters mainstream school for the first time.

Palacio drew inspiration for the story from two sources: singer Natalie Merchant's song "Wonder" and a real-life experience in which Palacio's young son reacted with distress upon seeing a girl with facial deformities at an ice cream shop. The novel explores themes of kindness, acceptance, prejudice, bullying, and the courage required to embrace difference.

PLOT

August "Auggie" Pullman is a ten-year-old boy living in North Riverside Heights in Upper Manhattan. He has Treacher Collins syndrome, which has disfigured his face and required many surgeries and years of special care. Due to his condition, Auggie has been homeschooled by his mother for several years. Wanting him to experience the world, his parents enroll him at Beecher Prep, a private school, for the start of fifth grade.

--- Starting School ---

Before the school year begins, Auggie's mother takes him to meet the principal, Mr. Tushman, who has arranged for three students — Jack Will, Charlotte, and Julian Albans — to give him a tour of the school. Julian treats Auggie unkindly while acting respectful in front of adults. On his first day, Auggie tries to avoid drawing attention to himself but is bullied by Julian and his friends. A classmate named Summer befriends him at lunch, and he is paired in most classes with Jack, whom he also considers a friend.

--- The Halloween Incident ---

On Halloween, Auggie dresses as Bleeding Scream instead of the Boba Fett costume he had originally planned. He overhears Jack joining Julian and his friends in making fun of him. Devastated, Auggie stays home for several days, decides never to return to school, and isolates himself from his family.

--- Reconciliation and Division ---

When Auggie returns to school, he ignores Jack and confides in Summer about the incident. Summer hints to Jack about why Auggie is upset. When Jack realizes what happened, he is ashamed and recommits to his friendship with Auggie. This draws Julian's ire, and Jack and Julian get into a fight. Julian's influence divides the students into factions, and Julian's mother writes to Mr. Tushman expressing concerns that Auggie's appearance is too much of a burden for the other students.

--- Via's Story ---

Meanwhile, Auggie's older sister Olivia "Via" Pullman is entering her first year of high school. She confides to her mother that she does not want Auggie to attend her school play, as she has enjoyed the fresh start her new school has given her. Auggie overhears and sulks in his room. Via comes to tell him their dog Daisy is dying, and he comes out to say goodbye before Daisy is taken to the vet and euthanized.

Via's best friend Miranda has been avoiding her. Both audition for the lead in their school play, and Miranda gets the part, with Via as understudy. On opening night, Miranda sees Via's family in the audience and feigns illness so Via can take her place. After the show, the two reconcile.

--- The Nature Reserve ---

At the end of the school year, the fifth grade goes on a three-day trip to a nature reserve. On the last night, Auggie and Jack are walking in the woods when they are attacked by a group of older students from another school. Julian's friends happen to walk by and rush to defend their classmates, impressed by Auggie's boldness in standing up to the bullies. After this incident, Auggie becomes accepted by his school peers.

At graduation, Auggie is awarded the Henry Ward Beecher Medal for his strength and character throughout the school year. Julian's parents decide to send Julian to a different school the following year.

CRITICAL RECEPTION

Wonder received primarily positive reviews from professional critics. Common Sense Media gave it four out of five stars, calling it "a moving, uplifting tale about a disfigured boy with inner beauty." Entertainment Weekly said: "In a wonder of a debut, Palacio has written a crackling page-turner filled with characters you can't help but root for."

The New York Times praised the novel as "rich and memorable," noting that "it's Auggie and the rest of the children who are the real heart of Wonder, and Palacio captures the voices of girls and boys, fifth graders, and teenagers, with equal skill."

Reviews from disability rights activists were more mixed. Disability activist Carly Findlay identified strongly with the story, saying "as a reader with a visible difference, I will say that it's very well researched." However, Mike Moody, writing on the Disability in Kidlit blog, described the book as "an engaging, heart-rending story about disfigurement" but expressed disappointment over the "missed opportunity" in the continued downplaying of the main character's disability and his persistent lack of agency.

Ariel Henley, an author with Crouzon syndrome, wrote in Teen Vogue that "Auggie is used as a prop to teach those around him about acceptance and compassion," arguing that the novel focuses more on the emotional journeys of the non-disabled characters than on Auggie's own experience.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

R.J. Palacio is the pen name of Raquel Jaramillo, an American author and graphic designer. Before writing Wonder, her debut novel, Palacio had a long career as an art director and book jacket designer in the publishing industry.

Palacio was inspired to write Wonder after an incident in which her young son became frightened upon seeing a child with a severe craniofacial condition. The encounter prompted Palacio to reflect on themes of kindness, compassion, and the experience of children who look different from their peers.

Wonder was Palacio's first novel and became an international bestseller, establishing her as a major voice in children's literature. She has continued to write companion works set in the Wonder universe and is an advocate for kindness initiatives inspired by the book's central message: "When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."
