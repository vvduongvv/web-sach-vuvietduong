ABOUT THIS BOOK

The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses is a 2011 book by American entrepreneur Eric Ries. It outlines the lean startup methodology, a framework for startup development that prioritizes rapid prototyping, validated learning, and iterative product releases. The goal of this methodology is to shorten product development cycles.

The methodology advocates for building a minimum viable product and gathering user feedback to refine the offering of a product over time. Ries reports developing this approach based on his experiences as a startup advisor and founder, following challenges faced with his first startup.

The lean startup method draws on ideas from lean manufacturing and agile development. It focuses on adapting strategies based on experimentation and user feedback rather than relying on long-term business planning.

Some organizations have implemented the lean startup approach, including Alphabet Energy, Dropbox, Wealthfront, and General Electric.

RECEPTION

According to the publisher, the book's sales exceed one million copies, and it has been translated into over thirty languages. It also appeared on The New York Times Best Sellers list in the 'Hardcover Advice & Misc.' category in 2011.

Academic responses to the methodology have been mixed. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, supported the focus on experimentation and learning but raised concerns about the emphasis on early customer input in cases involving novel technologies. He also noted limitations in tools such as the business model canvas. Bocken and Snihur conclude that more research is required to understand the process of experimentation, and highlight the limited academic knowledge of the process.
