ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Me Before You" is a deeply moving and emotionally complex novel by Jojo Moyes that explores love, disability, quality of life, and the choices we make for those we care about. The story follows Louisa "Lou" Clark, a quirky, working-class young woman in a small English town who has never traveled far or dreamed big. When she loses her job at a café, she takes a position as a caretaker for Will Traynor, a wealthy, adventurous young man who became a quadriplegic after a motorcycle accident.

Will is bitter and withdrawn, having lost the life he once loved — extreme sports, travel, high-powered business deals. He resents his dependence and has secretly given his parents six months before he plans to end his life through assisted suicide at Dignitas in Switzerland. Lou, unaware of this timeline at first, is determined to show Will that life is still worth living.

As Lou and Will spend more time together, a deep bond forms between them. Lou challenges Will to experience joy again, while Will pushes Lou to expand her horizons and pursue a life beyond her small-town existence. The novel builds toward a devastating climax that forces both characters — and readers — to confront impossible questions about love, autonomy, and what it means to truly live.

KEY THEMES

1. Quality of Life and Autonomy — The novel bravely explores the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives, even when those decisions are heartbreaking to loved ones.

2. Love as Transformation — Both Lou and Will are fundamentally changed by their relationship. Lou discovers ambition and courage she never knew she had, while Will finds unexpected moments of happiness.

3. Class and Ambition — Lou's working-class background and limited aspirations contrast sharply with Will's privileged former life, highlighting how circumstance shapes our expectations.

4. Disability and Perception — The novel challenges assumptions about disability, showing both the frustrations Will experiences and the full emotional life he still leads.

5. Sacrifice and Selflessness — The story asks whether love means supporting someone's choices even when you profoundly disagree with them.
