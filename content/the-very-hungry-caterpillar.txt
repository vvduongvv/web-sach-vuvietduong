SYNOPSIS

One night, a little egg lies on a leaf. On an early Sunday morning, "a tiny and very hungry caterpillar" hatches from his egg and immediately begins searching for food. For the following five days, the caterpillar eats through an increasing quantity of fruit: one apple on Monday, two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, four strawberries on Thursday, and five oranges on Friday. However, the caterpillar remains hungry. On Saturday, he feasts on an assortment of food: a piece of chocolate cake, an ice-cream cone, a pickle, a slice of Swiss cheese, a slice of salami, a lollipop, a piece of cherry pie, a sausage, a cupcake, and a slice of watermelon. Later that night, the caterpillar gets a stomachache from overeating.

The following Sunday, the caterpillar eats a green leaf, relieving his stomachache. Now a "big, fat caterpillar", he builds a cocoon around himself and rests inside for more than two weeks. Afterwards, he nibbles a hole and pushes his way out, emerging as a large, multi-colored butterfly.

WRITING AND PUBLICATION

The Very Hungry Caterpillar is the third book Carle illustrated and only the second he wrote himself. The plot originated as a story called A Week with Willi the Worm, which featured a bookworm named Willi. Carle was inspired to write the story after using a hole punch that reminded him of a worm. Ann Beneduce, Carle's editor, advised him that a worm would not make a likable protagonist, instead recommending a caterpillar.

Carle was allegedly inspired to include holes in the pages where the caterpillar had "eaten" through the various foods, by differently shaped books he had read as a child in Germany.

The book was initially published by the World Publishing Company (US) in 1969. It was originally printed in Japan due to high US publishing costs resulting from the holes in some of the pages. Currently, the book is published by Penguin Random House, who acquired the title from Carle in 2019.

Since its release, The Very Hungry Caterpillar has sold over 50 million copies, approximately one copy every thirty seconds. It has been translated into more than 60 languages, including Arabic, Dutch, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, and Hebrew.

--- Awards ---

The book has won numerous awards including the American Institute of Graphic Arts Award in 1970, the Best Children's Books of England in 1970, the Selection du Grand Prix des Treize in France in 1972, and the Nakamori Reader's Prize in Japan in 1975. Additionally, The New York Times also cited it as one of the "Ten Best Picture Books of the Year" in 1969.

Furthermore, the book placed at number 199 in the Big Read, a 2003 poll conducted by the BBC to determine the United Kingdom's best loved books. It was one of the few picture books to place on the list. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children". Five years later, a School Library Journal survey of readers named The Very Hungry Caterpillar as the second-best children's book.

In 2020, The Very Hungry Caterpillar was number ten on the list of "Top Check Outs of All Time" by the New York Public Library. It also won the best children's classic accolade at the Sainsbury Children’s Book Awards in 2019. Carle said that this award was a "perfect way" to celebrate the book's 50th anniversary.

--- Scientific accuracy ---

The moth-related term cocoon is used instead of the proper butterfly term chrysalis. After many inquiries, Carle explained that it was intentional:

"And here's my unscientific explanation: My caterpillar is very unusual. As you know caterpillars don't eat lollipops and ice cream, so you won't find my caterpillar in any field guides. But also, when I was a small boy, my father would say, 'Eric, come out of your cocoon.' He meant I should open up and be receptive to the world around me. For me, it would not sound right to say, 'Come out of your chrysalis.' And so poetry won over science!"

--- Healthy eating ---

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC, philanthropic groups, and anti-obesity campaigns have used the book in nutrition outreach. In 2011, the AAP sent special copies of the book to health providers as part of a healthy foods campaign.

CULTURAL INFLUENCE

This book was used by former first lady Barbara Bush as part of her campaign to promote literacy. In 1999, Pizza Hut asked all 50 U.S. governors to name their favorite books from childhood. The then-governor of Texas and son of Barbara, George W. Bush, named The Very Hungry Caterpillar, despite having been 23 years old at the time of its publication.

In 2009, Google celebrated the book's 40th anniversary by rendering the logo on its main search page in the style used in the book.
