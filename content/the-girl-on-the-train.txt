ABOUT THIS BOOK

"The Girl on the Train" follows Rachel Watson, a divorced woman who rides the commuter train between her suburb and London every day. From the window, she watches the same houses pass by, including one where a young couple lives — a couple she has named "Jess and Jason." She imagines their perfect life and finds comfort in the fantasy. Then one morning, Rachel sees something shocking from the train window, and shortly afterward, the woman she calls "Jess" goes missing.

Unable to keep what she saw to herself, Rachel goes to the police and becomes entangled in the investigation. But Rachel is not a reliable witness — she is an alcoholic prone to blackouts, and her memories of that morning are fragmented and unreliable. As the narrative unfolds through three women's perspectives — Rachel, Megan (the missing woman), and Anna (Rachel's ex-husband's new wife) — the truth emerges in devastating pieces.

A massive international bestseller, "The Girl on the Train" became one of the defining thrillers of the 2010s, selling over 20 million copies and inspiring a major film adaptation. Its exploration of unreliable memory, toxic relationships, and female rage struck a powerful chord with readers worldwide.
