OVERVIEW

Educated is a memoir by Tara Westover, published in 2018 by Random House. The book recounts Westover's experience growing up in a survivalist family in rural Idaho and her journey from receiving no formal education to earning a PhD from Cambridge University. It became an instant number-one New York Times bestseller and has sold more than eight million copies worldwide.

The memoir explores themes of family, education, self-invention, the struggle for identity, and the painful process of separating from a family whose values conflict with one's own development. Westover has described the book as "not about education in the sense that people often think of it — not about degrees and formalities — but about self-discovery, about the life of the mind."

SUMMARY

--- Early Life in Idaho ---

Tara Westover was born in 1986 in Clifton, Idaho, the youngest of seven children in a family led by her father Gene, a devout Mormon survivalist who distrusted the government and mainstream institutions. Gene operated a junkyard and required his children to work in it from a young age, exposing them to dangerous conditions. The family did not use hospitals, relying instead on herbal remedies prepared by Tara's mother Faye, who worked as an unlicensed midwife and herbalist.

Gene was deeply paranoid about government authority and believed the end of the world was imminent. He refused to send his children to school, and although the family nominally homeschooled, the education was inconsistent and often nonexistent. Several of the children had no birth certificates, and Tara did not have one until she was nine years old.

--- Abuse and Family Dynamics ---

The memoir describes years of physical and emotional abuse within the family, particularly by Tara's older brother Shawn. Westover recounts incidents of Shawn's violent behavior toward her and other family members. The parents' response to the abuse was inadequate, and in some cases they denied it was occurring.

Despite the dysfunction, the family was also bound by deep ties of loyalty and shared experience. Tara's brother Tyler was an important early influence, encouraging her love of learning and eventually helping her prepare for college.

--- Path to Education ---

Encouraged by Tyler, Tara began studying on her own and took the ACT examination. She scored well enough to be admitted to Brigham Young University (BYU), despite having never attended a day of school. At BYU, she encountered unfamiliar concepts like the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement for the first time.

Tara struggled academically and socially at first, but gradually excelled. A professor recognized her potential and encouraged her to apply for study abroad programs. She won a place at Cambridge University through the BYU study abroad program and was subsequently awarded the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship, which funded her master's degree.

--- Cambridge and Harvard ---

At Cambridge, Tara flourished intellectually but continued to struggle with the psychological legacy of her upbringing. She earned her MPhil and then entered a PhD program. She also spent time as a visiting fellow at Harvard University during her doctoral studies.

Throughout this period, her relationship with her family became increasingly strained. Tara's parents and several siblings pressured her to recant her accounts of the abuse she had experienced. When she refused, much of her family cut off contact with her.

--- Completing the PhD ---

Despite the personal turmoil, Tara completed her PhD in history at Cambridge University in 2014. Her dissertation examined the intellectual history of Mormonism and the American West. The completion of her doctorate represented not just an academic achievement but the culmination of her journey from a girl with no formal education to a scholar at one of the world's most prestigious universities.

PEOPLE IN THE MEMOIR

The memoir features numerous family members and other figures. Tara's father Gene is portrayed as a complex figure — charismatic and hardworking but also paranoid, controlling, and potentially suffering from bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions. Her mother Faye is depicted as caught between her husband's extreme views and her love for her children. Brother Tyler is shown as a positive influence who encouraged Tara's education, while brother Shawn is the primary source of physical abuse.

Westover has noted that she changed the names of several family members in the book and that she verified her accounts by consulting with siblings, journals, and other sources. She has also acknowledged that her parents dispute many of the events described in the memoir.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

Westover has spoken about her motivation for writing the memoir in numerous interviews. She has said that the book is not a condemnation of her family but an attempt to understand her own experience and the power of education to transform a person's understanding of the world.

In interviews, Westover has drawn a distinction between forgiveness and reconciliation, stating that she has worked to forgive her family while accepting that reconciliation may not be possible. She has also discussed the broader themes of the book, including the way that family narratives can shape and limit individual identity.
