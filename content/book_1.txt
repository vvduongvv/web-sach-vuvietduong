THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY
by Matt Haig (2020)

ABOUT THIS BOOK

Between life and death, there is a library — and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices. Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?

Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library after her worst day on Earth. Overwhelmed by despair, she feels she has let down everyone around her — her brother, her best friend, her former fiancé, even her cat. But when she arrives at the library, presided over by her old school librarian Mrs. Elm, Nora discovers that she can try out alternate versions of her life. Each book on the shelves represents a different path — the life where she became a glaciologist, the life where she became a rock star, the life where she never broke up with Dan.

As Nora samples these different existences, she begins to understand that every life has its own set of regrets and joys. The perfect life she imagined may not be so perfect after all, and the life she left behind may have been more valuable than she ever realized. The Midnight Library is a poignant reflection on the choices that make us who we are and finding fulfillment in the life we already have.

KEY THEMES

1. Regret and Second Chances — The novel explores how regret can consume us, and what would truly happen if we could go back and make different choices. Nora learns that no life is free of disappointment.

2. The Meaning of Life — Through her many lives, Nora grapples with what makes life worth living. Is it achievement? Love? Connection? The answer proves more nuanced than she expected.

3. Mental Health and Depression — Haig addresses depression and suicidal ideation with sensitivity and compassion, drawing from his own experiences with mental illness.

4. The Butterfly Effect — Small decisions ripple outward in unexpected ways. A single choice can alter the trajectory of an entire life, but not always in the ways we predict.

5. Self-Acceptance — Ultimately, Nora must learn to accept herself and find peace with the life she has, rather than yearning for lives she hasn't lived.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"The only way to learn is to live."

"It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga."

"Never underestimate the big importance of small things."

"Want is an interesting word. It means lack. Sometimes if we fill that lack with something else, the original want disappears entirely."

"You don't have to understand life. You just have to live it."
