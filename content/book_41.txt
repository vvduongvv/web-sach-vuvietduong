ABOUT THIS BOOK

"People We Meet on Vacation" is a heartwarming and hilarious friends-to-lovers romance by Emily Henry. The novel follows Poppy Wright and Alex Nilsen, two best friends who could not be more different. Poppy is spontaneous, extroverted, and always chasing the next adventure as a travel writer. Alex is introverted, cautious, and content with his quiet life as a high school English teacher in their small hometown of Linfield, Ohio.

Despite their differences — or perhaps because of them — Poppy and Alex have been inseparable since they were paired together on a college carpool. For ten years, they have taken annual summer vacations together, each trip bringing them closer and creating memories that define their friendship. But two years ago, something happened on their trip to Croatia that shattered everything between them. They have barely spoken since.

Now, Poppy is miserable. Her dream life in New York City feels empty without Alex, and she devises a plan: one more vacation to fix everything between them. Over the course of a single summer trip — interwoven with flashbacks to their previous vacations — the truth about what happened in Croatia slowly emerges, along with the feelings they have both been hiding for over a decade.

KEY THEMES

1. Friends-to-Lovers — The novel beautifully explores the tension of falling in love with your best friend and the fear of risking a friendship that means everything.

2. Opposites Attract — Poppy and Alex's contrasting personalities create both comedy and chemistry, showing how differences can complement rather than divide.

3. The Meaning of Home — Poppy searches the world for fulfillment while Alex finds it in staying put, and the novel suggests that home is ultimately a person, not a place.

4. Communication and Vulnerability — The central conflict stems from unspoken feelings and misunderstandings, highlighting how fear of vulnerability can cost us the people we love most.

5. Nostalgia and Memory — The non-linear structure celebrates the vacations and ordinary moments that build a relationship over time.
