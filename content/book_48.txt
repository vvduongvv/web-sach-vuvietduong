ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Wonder" is a powerful and deeply moving novel by R.J. Palacio about a boy with a severe facial difference who enters public school for the first time. August "Auggie" Pullman was born with a rare craniofacial condition that has required 27 surgeries by the time he is ten years old. His face is dramatically different from other children's, and he has been homeschooled by his mother his entire life.

When Auggie's parents decide it is time for him to attend Beecher Prep, a private middle school in Manhattan, Auggie must navigate a world that often judges people by how they look. Despite his remarkable intelligence, sharp humor, and warm heart, Auggie faces stares, whispers, and outright cruelty from classmates who struggle to see past his appearance.

The novel is told from multiple perspectives — Auggie, his sister Via, her boyfriend Justin, Auggie's friends Jack and Summer, and others — creating a rich, empathetic portrait of how one child's journey affects everyone around him. It is a story about kindness, acceptance, and the courage it takes to be yourself in a world that doesn't always make it easy.

KEY THEMES

2. Appearance vs. Reality — Auggie's story challenges readers to look beyond the surface and see the person within, questioning society's obsession with physical appearance.

3. Courage and Resilience — Auggie shows incredible bravery in facing a world that often treats him as different, demonstrating that true courage is showing up every day despite your fears.

4. Perspective and Empathy — The multi-narrator structure forces readers to see events from multiple viewpoints, fostering understanding that everyone has their own struggles and stories.

5. Belonging and Friendship — The novel explores what it means to fit in, to stand out, and to find people who accept you exactly as you are.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."

"I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives."

"Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed."

"The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average — though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched along the way."

"Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives because we all overcometh the world."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Part 1 — August: Auggie introduces himself with characteristic humor, acknowledging his unusual face. He tours Beecher Prep, meeting students who react with shock and discomfort. His first days are a minefield of stares, avoidance, and the "plague" game where students avoid touching him.

Part 2 — Via: Auggie's older sister Olivia ("Via") shares her perspective. She loves her brother but feels invisible in a family that revolves around his medical needs. Her own struggles with identity, friendship, and the transition to high school are honestly portrayed.

Part 3 — Summer: A classmate named Summer befriends Auggie at lunch, not out of pity but because she genuinely likes him. Her perspective shows how choosing kindness can be simple and transformative.

Part 4 — Jack: Jack Will, Auggie's first friend at Beecher Prep, narrates his conflicting feelings. When Auggie overhears Jack saying hurtful things about him to fit in with other boys, their friendship shatters.

Part 5 — Justin: Via's boyfriend Justin observes the Pullman family and the school dynamics with an outsider's perspective, adding depth to the story's exploration of how we treat those who are different.

Part 6 — August (continued): Auggie navigates the fallout from Jack's betrayal, a class bully's escalating harassment, and the support of unexpected allies. A confrontation during a school camping trip becomes a turning point.

Part 7 — Miranda and the Graduation: Via's former best friend Miranda contributes her perspective, and the novel builds toward Auggie's fifth-grade graduation, where he receives the school's highest honor — a standing ovation that celebrates not just his survival but his triumph.

WHY READ THIS BOOK?

"Wonder" is a book that changes how you see the world. R.J. Palacio has created a story so authentic and emotionally resonant that it has sparked a global kindness movement — the "Choose Kind" campaign. Through Auggie's eyes, readers experience the pain of being different and the healing power of acceptance and compassion.

This is essential reading for children and adults. It teaches empathy in the most direct way possible: by inviting you into the mind and heart of someone whose experience is likely very different from your own. After reading "Wonder," you will never look at a stranger the same way again.
