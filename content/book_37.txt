ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Outlander" is a sweeping historical romance that blends adventure, science fiction, and passionate love into an unforgettable epic. The novel follows Claire Randall, a former World War II combat nurse who, in 1945, is on a second honeymoon in the Scottish Highlands with her husband Frank. While visiting the mysterious standing stones at Craigh na Dun, Claire is transported two hundred years into the past, to 1743 Scotland on the eve of the Jacobite risings.

Stranded in a dangerous and unfamiliar time, Claire is forced to marry Jamie Fraser, a gallant young Scottish warrior, to protect herself from the sadistic English officer Captain Jonathan "Black Jack" Randall — an ancestor of her twentieth-century husband. What begins as a marriage of convenience gradually deepens into an all-consuming love that forces Claire to choose between two vastly different lives and two very different men.

Diana Gabaldon weaves meticulous historical detail with gripping storytelling, creating a world so vivid and immersive that readers feel transported alongside Claire. The result is a novel that defies genre boundaries, appealing to fans of romance, historical fiction, adventure, and fantasy alike.

Diana Gabaldon's prose is lush and immersive, and her characters are complex, flawed, and deeply human.
