ABOUT THIS BOOK

"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" tells the extraordinary true story of a poor Black tobacco farmer from Virginia whose cancer cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951 and became one of the most important tools in modern medicine. Known as HeLa cells, they were the first human cells to survive and thrive in a laboratory, and they have been used in countless medical breakthroughs — from developing the polio vaccine to advances in cancer treatment, gene mapping, and in vitro fertilization.

Yet Henrietta Lacks herself was largely forgotten by history, and her family had no idea that her cells were being bought and sold by the billions around the world. They could not afford health insurance while scientists profited from the cells that had been taken from their mother and grandmother without consent. Rebecca Skloot spent more than a decade researching and building trust with the Lacks family to tell this story.

The book weaves together three narratives: the science of HeLa cells, the biography of Henrietta Lacks, and the story of her daughter Deborah's quest to learn about the mother she never knew. It is simultaneously a science story, a social justice story, and a deeply human story about family, race, and ethics.

KEY THEMES

1. **Medical Ethics and Informed Consent** — Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or permission. The book raises urgent questions about patients' rights, bodily autonomy, and the ethics of medical research.

2. **Race and Medicine** — The exploitation of Henrietta's cells cannot be separated from the history of medical experimentation on Black Americans, from slavery to the Tuskegee syphilis study.

3. **Science and Humanity** — The HeLa cells have saved millions of lives, but behind them was a real woman with a family. The book insists that we remember the human beings behind scientific progress.

4. **Legacy and Remembrance** — Deborah Lacks's fierce determination to learn her mother's story is a testament to the power of legacy and the need to reclaim erased histories.

5. **The Commodification of the Body** — HeLa cells became a multi-billion-dollar industry. The question of who owns human biological material — and who profits from it — remains unresolved.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"

"Like I always say — if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."

"Scientists don't like to think of HeLa cells as being a person. It's much easier to do science when you dissociate your materials from the people they come from."

"Her cells have been buying and selling by the billions, and no one told her family a thing."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Part 1: Life — Henrietta Lacks is born in Roanoke, Virginia, and raised by her grandfather in a community of tobacco farmers. She marries David "Day" Lacks and moves to Baltimore, where she is diagnosed with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. A sample of her tumor is given to researcher George Gey.

Part 2: Death — Henrietta dies at age 31, but her cells prove extraordinary — they reproduce indefinitely in the lab. HeLa cells are mass-produced and shipped to researchers worldwide. The Lacks family is never informed.

Part 3: Immortality — Decades later, the Lacks family learns about the cells through a chance encounter. Deborah Lacks begins a quest to understand who her mother was and what happened to her cells. The family grapples with exploitation, distrust, and the desire for recognition.

Part 4: The Author's Journey — Skloot's own decade-long process of gaining the family's trust and conducting research is woven throughout. Her relationship with Deborah becomes a central emotional thread.

Part 5: Aftermath — The book addresses the ongoing legal and ethical questions surrounding HeLa cells and describes the Lacks family's continuing struggle for recognition and justice.

WHY READ THIS BOOK?

"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" is that rare book that operates on every level — as science writing, as investigative journalism, as social history, and as a deeply moving human story. Skloot refuses to let Henrietta be reduced to her cells; she insists on the full, complex humanity of a woman whose contribution to science was as involuntary as it was immeasurable.

The book raises questions that remain urgently relevant: Who owns your body? What rights do patients have over their own tissues? How do systemic racism and economic inequality shape who benefits from medical progress? It is essential reading for anyone who cares about science, justice, or the stories we choose not to tell.
