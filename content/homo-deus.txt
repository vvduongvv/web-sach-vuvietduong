ABOUT THIS BOOK

Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (Hebrew: ההיסטוריה של המחר (Romanised: hahistoria shel hamachar), English: The History of the Tomorrow) is a book written by Israeli author Yuval Noah Harari, professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The book was first published in Hebrew in 2015 by Dvir publishing; the English-language version was published in September 2016 in the United Kingdom and in February 2017 in the United States.

As with its predecessor, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Harari recounts the course of human history while describing events and the individual human experience, along with ethical issues in relation to his historical survey. However, Homo Deus (from Latin "Homo" meaning man or human and "Deus" meaning God) deals more with the abilities acquired by humans (Homo sapiens) throughout their existence, and their evolution as the dominant species in the world. The book describes mankind's current abilities and achievements and attempts to paint an image of the future. Many philosophical issues are discussed, such as humanism, individualism, transhumanism, and mortality.

SUMMARY

The book sets out to examine possibilities of the future of Homo sapiens. The premise outlines that during the 21st century, humanity is likely to make a significant attempt to gain happiness, immortality, and God-like powers. Throughout the book, Harari openly speculates various ways that this ambition might be realised in the future based on the past and present. The book focuses as well on humanism, religion and capitalism and compares the two throughout the book.

--- Homo sapiens conquers the world ---

• The first part of the book explores the relationship between humans and other animals, exploring what led to the former's dominance over the latter.

• Harari speculates as well why homo sapiens and not neanderthals rule the world.

--- Homo sapiens gives meaning to the world ---

• Since the language revolution some 70,000 years ago, humans have lived within an "intersubjective reality", such as countries, borders, religion, money and companies, all created to enable large-scale, flexible cooperation between different individual human beings. Humanity is separated from other animals by humans' ability to believe in these intersubjective constructs that exist only in the human mind and are given force through collective belief.

• Humankind's immense ability to give meaning to its actions and thoughts is what has enabled its many achievements.

• Harari argues that humanism is a form of religion that worships humankind instead of a god. It puts humankind and its desires as a top priority in the world, in which humans themselves are framed as the dominant beings. Humanists believe that ethics and values are derived internally within each individual, rather than from an external source. During the 21st century, Harari believes that humanism may push humans to search for immortality, happiness, and power.

• The book explores three different kinds of humanism including socialist humanism, evolutionary humanism and liberal humanism. Harari discusses their advantages as well as their impact on society throughout history and explores their chore doctrines and ideology. Harari speculates about various theories why different kinds of humanism have conquered the world throughout the last centuries and compares them in various aspects to religion.

• Hararis concludes that humanism is "the leading world religion" because humanism is flexible and adapts itself to new inventions and changes in society. The book states that religion has lost influence throughout previous centuries because religion tries to solve problems and answer questions by looking for the answer in holy scripts, whereas humanism in comparison would solve problems through science, research and innovation.

--- Homo sapiens loses control ---

"What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

• Technological developments have threatened the continued ability of humans to give meaning to their lives; Harari suggests the possibility of the replacement of humankind with the super-man, or "homo deus" (human god) endowed with abilities such as eternal life.

• The last chapter suggests the possibility that humans are algorithms, and as such Homo sapiens may not be dominant in a universe where big data becomes a paradigm. As humans absorb more data, they become more algorithmic and more efficient at processing data, which gives humans deeper emotions and superior intellectual abilities. However, the rapidly growing data may ultimately consume humans in the sense that nothing that originally made us human is left, and make humans obsolete.

• The book closes with the following question addressed to the reader:"What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

"What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

RECEPTION

Homo Deus was reviewed or discussed in The New York Times, The Guardian, The Economist, The New Yorker, NPR, Financial Times, and Times Higher Education.

Steve Aoki's song "Homo Deus" on the album Neon Future IV is named after the book and features Harari's narration of the audiobook.

Writing in The Guardian, David Runciman praised the book's originality and style, although he suggested that it lacked empathy for Homo sapiens. The review points out that "Harari cares about the fate of animals in a human world but he writes about the prospects for Homo sapiens in a data-driven world with a lofty insouciance." He also added: "Harari would probably be the first to admit, it's [the book] only intelligent by human standards, which are nothing special. By the standards of the smartest machines it’s woolly and speculative." Runciman nonetheless gave the book a generally positive review.

In a mixed review, The Economist called Homo Deus "a glib work, full of corner-cutting sleights of hand and unsatisfactory generalisations" and stated that "Mr Harari has a tendency towards scientific name-dropping—words like biotech, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence abound—but he rarely engages with these topics in any serious way."

Writing in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, Allan McCay has challenged Harari's claims about human algorithmic agency.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Yuval Noah Harari (born 1976) is an Israeli medievalist, military historian, public intellectual, and popular science writer. He is a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His first bestselling book, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2011) is based on his lectures to an undergraduate world history class. His other works include the bestsellers Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2016), 21 Lessons for the 21st Century (2018), and Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI (2024). His published work examines themes of free will, consciousness, intelligence, happiness, suffering and the role of storytelling in human evolution.
In Sapiens, Harari writes about a "cognitive revolution" that supposedly occurred roughly 70,000 years ago when Homo sapiens supplanted the rival Neanderthals and other species of the genus Homo, developed language skills and structured societies, and ascended as apex predators, aided by the First Agricultural Revolution and accelerated by the Scientific Revolution, which have allowed humans to approach near mastery over their environment. Furthermore, he examines the possible consequences of a futuristic biotechnological world in which intelligent biological organisms are surpassed by their own creations; he has said, "Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so". Although Harari's books have received considerable commercial success since the publication of Sapiens, his work has been more negatively received in academic circles.
In 2019, Yuval Noah Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, founded Sapienship, a social impact company that advocates for global responsibility. Their mission is to tell and retell the shared story of humanity in order to promote trust and cooperation between all people. The company focuses on research, content development, education, and the publication of position papers on global challenges in the fields of technology and the future world order. Sapienship has also launched an official educational Instagram page.
