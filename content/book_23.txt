Cracking the Coding Interview
by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

ABOUT THIS BOOK

"Cracking the Coding Interview" is the most widely used book for preparing for technical interviews at top technology companies. Now in its 6th edition (2015), the book contains 189 programming questions and solutions, covering the full spectrum of topics that candidates encounter at companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. It has helped millions of engineers land their dream jobs.

Beyond just presenting problems and solutions, the book provides a comprehensive framework for interview preparation. It covers the entire hiring process — from resume crafting to behavioral questions to offer negotiation. The technical sections are organized by topic, progressing from fundamental data structures and algorithms to more specialized topics like system design and object-oriented design. Each solution includes detailed explanations of the thought process, not just the final code.

What makes this book particularly valuable is that the author draws on her experience as both a software engineer at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, and as a hiring committee member. This dual perspective means the book addresses not only what to solve but how to communicate your thinking during an interview, how to handle hints, and how to recover from mistakes.

KEY THEMES

1. Problem-Solving Process — The book emphasizes a structured approach to solving problems: listen carefully, draw examples, state a brute force solution, optimize, walk through the algorithm, implement, and test. This framework applies beyond interviews to everyday engineering.

2. Data Structures Mastery — Arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, heaps, tries, and hash tables are covered extensively. Understanding when and why to use each data structure is crucial.

3. Algorithm Patterns — Common algorithmic approaches including recursion, dynamic programming, BFS/DFS, sorting, searching, and bit manipulation are presented with multiple practice problems for each.

4. Communication Skills — Technical interviews are as much about communication as coding. The book teaches candidates to verbalize their thought process, ask clarifying questions, and discuss trade-offs.

5. Big-O Analysis — Every solution includes time and space complexity analysis. The book teaches readers to evaluate and optimize their solutions using asymptotic notation.

NOTABLE QUOTES

"The fact is, the interview process is not random. It's predictable, and with the right preparation, you can nail it."

"It's not about memorizing solutions. It's about learning to think about problems in the right way."

"Don't try to solve the whole problem at once. Break it down."

"You should think of a brute force solution first. It's okay to start with something slow, as long as you can optimize from there."

"The best candidates aren't the ones who solve every problem; they're the ones who communicate clearly and work methodically."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

Chapter I: The Interview Process — Explains how hiring works at major tech companies, what interviewers look for, how decisions are made, and common misconceptions about the process.

Chapter II: Behind the Scenes — Provides insider details on interview processes at Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and startups, including how many rounds to expect and what each round covers.

Chapter III: Special Situations — Addresses unique scenarios including experienced candidates, PM roles, dev lead positions, testing roles, and acquisitions. Also covers visa and international considerations.

Chapter V: Behavioral Questions — Teaches candidates how to structure responses to behavioral questions using a project-based preparation grid and the SAR (Situation, Action, Result) framework.

Chapter VI: Big O — A thorough introduction to time and space complexity analysis, including amortized time, log N runtimes, recursive runtimes, and multi-part algorithms.

Chapter VII-IX: Technical Questions — Covers the problem-solving approach, presents all 189 coding problems organized by topic (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, recursion, dynamic programming, system design, etc.), and provides detailed solutions.

Chapter X: Solutions — Complete, well-commented solutions to all 189 problems with multiple approaches where applicable and detailed complexity analysis.

WHY READ THIS BOOK?

If you are preparing for software engineering interviews at any level, this book is essential. It provides a structured approach that transforms interview preparation from an overwhelming task into a manageable process. The problems are carefully curated to represent the difficulty and style of real interview questions, and the solutions teach problem-solving strategies that transfer to new, unseen problems.

Even beyond interview preparation, the book serves as an excellent review of fundamental computer science concepts. Working through the problems strengthens your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem decomposition. Many engineers return to this book throughout their careers whenever they need to brush up on fundamentals or prepare for a career transition.
