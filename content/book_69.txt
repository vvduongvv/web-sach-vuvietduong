KEY THEMES

1. **The Intersection of Faith and History** — The novel challenges readers to consider how religious institutions have shaped historical narratives, and whether accepted truths may conceal deeper secrets buried for centuries.

2. **Symbolism and Hidden Knowledge** — Da Vinci's artwork serves as a canvas of concealed messages. The theme explores how symbols carry power across generations and how knowledge can be encoded in plain sight.

3. **The Sacred Feminine** — Brown explores the historical suppression of feminine divinity in Western religion, arguing that goddess worship was deliberately erased by patriarchal institutions.

4. **Power and Secrecy** — From the Priory of Sion to Opus Dei, the novel examines how secretive organizations wield influence and how the desire to control information drives human conflict.

5. **The Nature of Truth** — Throughout the story, characters grapple with what constitutes truth — whether it is found in faith, evidence, or personal belief.
